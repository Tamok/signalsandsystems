<p class="lead">
  Today marks the beginning of a new journey. I'm excited to share the creation process of <em>Signals &amp; Systems</em>,
  a personal publishing platform I'm building from the ground up to host long-form, interactive content.
</p>

## The Vision

As both an educator and technologist, I've always found myself at the intersection of content creation and technical implementation. I wanted a platform that would give me complete control over how my articles appear, how they function, and how they evolve over time. More importantly, I wanted a canvas for experimentation—a place where I could seamlessly blend written content with interactive elements.

<CalloutBox type="tip">
  When creating your own publishing platform, start with a clear vision of what you want to accomplish. This will guide your technical decisions and help you avoid unnecessary complexity.
</CalloutBox>

## Technology Choices

After evaluating several options, I settled on a tech stack that prioritizes performance, simplicity, and developer experience:

- **Astro**: A modern static site generator that delivers excellent performance by default, with minimal JavaScript.
- **Astro Components**: Using Astro's component system for creating reusable UI elements with HTML-like syntax.
- **MDX (Future)**: Planning to explore Markdown with JSX support for simpler content writing workflow.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that makes styling straightforward and consistent.
- **Google Analytics**: For basic audience insights while respecting privacy concerns.

  <ChartComponent description="My confidence level (0-100) in each technology choice for this platform." />
</div>

## Project Structure

I've organized the project with a focus on modularity and maintainability:

```
signals-and-systems/
├── src/
│   ├── components/    # Reusable UI components
│   ├── layouts/       # Page layout templates
│   ├── pages/         # Route definitions
│   └── styles/        # Global styles and Tailwind config
├── public/            # Static assets
└── astro.config.mjs   # Astro configuration
```

## The Design Philosophy

For this platform, I'm embracing a minimalist design approach with a focus on readability and content hierarchy. The typography is carefully chosen to ensure comfortable reading for long-form articles, and the color palette is subtle yet distinctive.

A key principle I'm following is "progressive enhancement"—ensuring that content is accessible and functional even without JavaScript, then layering interactivity for browsers that support it.

<CalloutBox type="info">
  Progressive enhancement is about building a solid foundation first, then adding features for capable browsers.
</CalloutBox>

## The Ethical Considerations

As I build this platform, I'm constantly thinking about the ethical dimensions of digital publishing:

- **Privacy**: Minimizing data collection and being transparent about what's collected.
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring content is accessible to all readers, regardless of ability.
- **Sustainability**: Building a platform with minimal environmental impact through efficient code and assets.
- **Vibecoding**: Exploring the balance between technical optimization and human-centered design.

## Visual Design Evolution

One of the key aspects of this platform is the visual design. I wanted to create a clean, distraction-free reading experience that still allows for interactive elements when needed. After experimenting with various approaches, I settled on:

- **SVG-based graphics** - Vector graphics provide crisp visuals at any resolution while keeping file sizes small
- **Custom author images** - Designed with integrated social media links to GitHub and LinkedIn
- **Visual hierarchy** - Typography scales and spacing to guide the reader through content
- **Subtle animations** - Used sparingly to provide feedback and draw attention where appropriate
