        <p class="text-sm">
          We believe in radical transparency about data collection. We collect minimal data, 
          only with your consent, and give you full control over your privacy choices. 
          Most importantly: <strong>declining analytics will not affect your experience on this site in any way.</strong>
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Signals & Systems is a personal publishing platform operated by JELL. 
        Our website address is: https://signalsandsystems.jellwrites.com/  or https://signalsys.dev
      </p>

      <h2>What Data We Collect and Why</h2>
      
      <h3>Analytics Data (Optional)</h3>
      <p>
        With your explicit consent, we use Google Tag Manager and GA4 to collect anonymous usage data including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pages visited and time spent on site</li>
        <li>Browser type and operating system</li>
        <li>Referring websites</li>
        <li>General geographic location (country/region level)</li>
        <li>Device type (desktop, mobile, tablet)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> To understand how visitors use our site and improve content and user experience. Also to make nice visualizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Legal Basis:</strong> Consent (GDPR Article 6(1)(a))
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Data Retention:</strong> Google Analytics retains this data for 26 months, after which it is automatically deleted.
      </p>

      <h3>Consent Preferences</h3>
      <p>
        We store your analytics consent choice (granted/denied) in your browser's local storage under the key 'ss-analytics-consent'.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> To remember your privacy preferences and avoid showing the consent popup repeatedly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Legal Basis:</strong> Legitimate interest (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) - necessary for the proper functioning of our consent system.
      </p>

      <h3>What We Don't Collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>No personal information (names, emails, addresses)</li>
        <li>No account creation or user profiles</li>
        <li>No tracking across other websites</li>
        <li>No selling of data to third parties</li>
        <li>No marketing emails or communications</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        The only data sharing occurs when you consent to analytics:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> Anonymous usage data is processed by Google under their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><strong>No other third parties</strong> receive any data from this website</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your Rights Under GDPR</h2>
      <p>You have the following rights regarding your data:</p>
      
      <h3>Right to Withdraw Consent</h3>
      <p>
        You can withdraw analytics consent at any time using the "Cookie & Analytics Preferences" link in the footer.
        This will stop all future data collection immediately.
      </p>

      <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
      <p>
        Since we only store your consent preference locally in your browser, 
        you can export this data yourself through your browser's developer tools.
      </p>

      <h3>Right to Deletion</h3>
      <p>
        To delete your consent preference: clear your browser's local storage for this site.
        For Google Analytics data deletion, you can request this through Google's 
        <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9450800" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data deletion process</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Right to Access</h3>
      <p>
        The only personal data we store is your consent preference, which you can view 
        in your browser's local storage or by checking which option is selected in our consent popup.
      </p>

      <h3>Right to Rectification</h3>
      <p>
        You can correct your consent preference at any time using the footer link.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can object to analytics processing by declining or withdrawing consent.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement appropriate technical measures to protect your data:
