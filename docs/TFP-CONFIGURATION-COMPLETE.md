# TFP Series Configuration - COMPLETED

## What Was Completed

### ✅ Series Page Created
- Created `src/pages/series/tfp.astro` - the main TFP series landing page
- Follows the same structure as other series (devlog, geo, isomon)
- Uses blue color scheme for TFP branding
- Shows all TFP articles in order with navigation

### ✅ Article Routing Created
- Created `src/pages/tfp/` directory for TFP articles
- Created `src/pages/tfp/[slug].astro` for individual article pages
- Enables proper routing for all TFP articles (e.g., `/tfp/00-introduction-friction-principle`)
- Includes series navigation (previous/next article links)

### ✅ Server Testing
- Development server started successfully on http://localhost:4322
- Verified TFP series shows up on main series page at `/series`
- Verified TFP series page works at `/series/tfp`
- Verified individual TFP articles work (e.g., `/tfp/00-introduction-friction-principle`)

### ✅ Content Verification
- All 6 TFP articles exist and are properly configured:
  - TFP-00: Introduction 
  - TFP-01: Cognitive Cost of Convenience
  - TFP-02: Augmentation Paradox (was not missing)
  - TFP-03: Designing for Deliberation
  - TFP-04: Collaboration Imperative 
  - TFP-05: Building Cognitive Resilience
- Series metadata (`tfp.json`) properly configured
- Content collection (`config.ts`) includes TFP

## Current Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

The TFP series is now completely configured and working properly within the Signals & Systems platform. Users can:

1. Browse all series at `/series` and see TFP listed
2. Visit the TFP series page at `/series/tfp` to see all articles
3. Read individual TFP articles at `/tfp/[article-slug]`
4. Navigate between articles using the series navigation

## Only Missing Items (Optional)

- **Cover Images**: The articles reference cover images (`/images/tfp-*-cover.svg`) that don't exist yet
  - Series and articles will work fine without them
  - Can be created later using the existing SVG template system

The series is ready for use and publication!
