# The Friction Principle (TFP) Series Structure

## Series Overview

**The Friction Principle** explores how intentional cognitive friction in AI systems can preserve and enhance human intellectual capacity while maximizing the benefits of artificial intelligence. This series investigates the delicate balance between AI assistance and cognitive autonomy, offering evidence-based strategies for human-AI collaboration that promotes learning, creativity, and critical thinking.

**Series Theme**: How to design and use AI as a cognitive multiplier rather than a cognitive replacement.

**Target Audience**: Educators, technologists, knowledge workers, and leaders navigating the AI transformation.
