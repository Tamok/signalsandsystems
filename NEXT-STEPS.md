# Draft: Devlog #3 – The Astro Content Collections Migration Epic

## Overview
This article chronicles our journey migrating the Signals & Systems blog from static, hardcoded Astro files to a modern, maintainable, and type-safe content system using Astro Content Collections and MDX. It covers the technical steps, the challenges, the backtracking, and the lessons learned.

## The Starting Point
- Articles were originally written as static `.astro` files in `src/pages/devlog/`.
- Content was hardcoded, making updates and navigation brittle and error-prone.
- Interactive components (charts, callouts, code blocks) were used, but not reusable across content.

## The Migration Plan
- Move all articles to `src/content/devlog/` as MDX files for rich content and component support.
- Define schemas for articles and series in `src/content/config.ts` using Zod for type safety.
- Implement utility functions in `src/utils/content.ts` to fetch, filter, and sort content from collections.
- Create dynamic routes (`[slug].astro`) for articles and series.

## What We Completed
- All devlog articles are now in MDX, matching the original .astro content and structure.
- Content schemas are validated and enforced.
- Navigation, linking, and slugs are correct and robust.
- All custom components render in MDX (e.g., `CalloutBox`, `ChartComponent`, `CodeBlock`).
- TypeScript errors and content sync issues are resolved.
- The site now loads and displays all articles as intended, with full navigation and interactivity.
- The migration, bugfixes, and article restoration are complete and documented in the changelog.

## Key Steps & Code Changes
- Created and validated schemas for articles and series.
- Migrated all content to `.mdx`, ensuring frontmatter matches schema.
- Updated all navigation and linking logic to use `/devlog/{slug}`.
- Refactored all utility functions to use `getCollection('devlog')` and return correct slugs.
- Ensured all custom components (e.g., `CalloutBox`, `ChartComponent`, `CodeBlock`) are imported and used in MDX.
- Added explicit TypeScript types to avoid implicit any[] errors in dynamic routes.

## Major Challenges & Debugging
- **Content Not Appearing:**
  - Root cause: Syntax error in `ConsentPopup.astro` broke Astro's content sync, causing all articles to disappear.
  - Solution: Fixed the syntax error, restarted dev server, and validated content sync.
- **Double-Prefixed Slugs:**
  - Root cause: Slugs were stored as `/devlog/{slug}` and then `/devlog/` was prepended again in links.
  - Solution: Store only the filename as slug, prepend `/devlog/` only in UI.
- **MDX Schema/Frontmatter Mismatches:**
  - Ensured all MDX frontmatter matches the Zod schema exactly.
- **Component Rendering in MDX:**
  - Ensured all .astro components are imported at the top of each MDX file.
- **TypeScript Errors:**
  - Added explicit types for all arrays and variables in dynamic routes.
- **Backtracking:**
  - Several times, fixes were made and then reverted due to new issues (e.g., navigation, slugs, or content not rendering).
  - Debug output and Astro's check tool were used to trace and resolve issues.

## Lessons Learned
- Astro's content system is powerful but strict: schema and frontmatter must match exactly.
- Syntax errors in any component can break the entire content sync.
- MDX enables rich, interactive content, but requires careful import and usage of components.
- Debugging content loading requires checking both code and build output.

## Next Steps
- Write a polished version of this article for the devlog.
- Continue refining the content system and adding new features.
- Document all custom components and utility functions for future contributors.
